# NAME

**vcf2dag**

# SYNOPSIS

**vcf2dag** [options] [<vcf file>]

# DESCRIPTION

Modify VCF to be able to build a directed acyclic graph (DAG)



# OPTIONS

```

options:
    -r, --reference FILE         FASTA reference file.

Modify the VCF file so that homozygous regions are included as REF/. calls.
For each ref and alt allele, assign an index.  These steps are sufficient to
enable use of the VCF as a DAG (specifically a partially-ordered graph).

Type: transformation

```
