# NAME

**vcfsamplediff**

# SYNOPSIS

**vcfsamplediff** [options] <tag> <sample> <sample> [ <sample> ... ] <vcf file>

# DESCRIPTION

Establish putative somatic variants using reported differences between germline and somatic samples. Tags each record where the listed sample genotypes differ with <tag>. The first sample is assumed to be germline, the second somatic. Each record is tagged with <tag>={germline,somatic,loh} to specify the type of variant given the genotype difference between the two samples.



# OPTIONS

```


options:
    -s --strict     Require that no observations in the germline support the somatic alternate.


Type: transformation

```
