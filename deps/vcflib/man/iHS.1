.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]iHS\f[R] \[en]target 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 \[en]file my.phased.vcf
\ \[en]region chr1:1-1000 > STDOUT 2> STDERR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]iHS\f[R] calculates the integrated haplotype score which measures
the relative decay of extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH) for the
reference and alternative alleles at a site (see: voight et al.\ 2006,
Spiech & Hernandez 2014).

Our code is highly concordant with both implementations mentioned. However, we do not set an upper limit to the allele frequency.  **iHS** can be run without a genetic map, in which case the change in EHH is integrated over a constant.  Human genetic maps for GRCh36 and GRCh37 (hg18 & hg19) can be found at: http://bochet.gcc.biostat.washington.edu/beagle/genetic_maps/ . **iHS** by default interpolates SNV positions to genetic position (you don\[aq]t need a genetic position for every VCF entry in the map file).

**iHS** analyses requires normalization by allele frequency.  It is important that **iHS** is calculated over large regions so that the normalization does not down weight real signals.  For genome-wide runs it is recommended to run slightly overlapping windows and throwing out values that fail integration (columns 7 & 8 in the output) and then removing duplicates by using the \[aq]sort\[aq] and \[aq]uniq\[aq] linux commands.  Normalization of the output is as simple as running \[aq]normalize-**iHS**\[aq].



     **iHS** calculates the integrated ratio of haplotype decay between the reference and non-reference allele.
Output : 4 columns :
     1. seqid
     2. position
     3. target allele frequency
     4. integrated EHH (alternative)
     5. integrated EHH (reference)
     6. **iHS** ln(iEHHalt/iEHHref)
     7. != 0 integration failure
     8. != 0 integration failure
