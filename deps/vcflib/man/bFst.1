.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]bFst\f[R] is a Bayesian approach to Fst.
Importantly \f[B]bFst\f[R] accounts for genotype uncertainty in the
model using genotype likelihoods.
For a more detailed description see: \[ga]A Bayesian approach to
inferring population structure from dominant markers\[cq] by Holsinger
et al.\ Molecular Ecology Vol 11, issue 7 2002.
The likelihood function has been modified to use genotype likelihoods
provided by variant callers.
There are five free parameters estimated in the model: each
subpopulation\[cq]s allele frequency and Fis (fixation index, within
each subpopulation), a free parameter for the total population\[cq]s
allele frequency, and Fst.
