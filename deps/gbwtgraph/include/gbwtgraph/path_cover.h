/*
  Find a path cover of the graph with n paths per component and return a GBWT of the paths.
  The path cover is built greedily. Each time we extend a path, we choose the extension
  where the coverage of the k >= 2 node window is the lowest. Note that this is a maximum
  coverage algorithm that tries to maximize the number of windows covered by a fixed number
  of paths.

  This algorithm has been inspired by:

    Ghaffaari and Marschall: Fully-sensitive seed finding in sequence graphs using a
    hybrid index. Bioinformatics, 2019.

  Because the graph here may have cycles and orientation flips, some changes were necessary:

    - If the component is not a DAG, we start from an arbitrary node with minimal
      coverage and extend in both directions.

    - In a DAG, we start from the head node with the lowest coverage so far.

    - We stop when the length of the path reaches the size of the component.

    - The length of the window is in nodes instead of base pairs. We expect a sparse graph,
      where the nodes between variants are long.

    - If the component is not a DAG and the path is shorter than k - 1 nodes, we consider
      the coverage of individual nodes instead of windows.

    - When determining window coverage, we consider the window equivalent to its reverse
      complement.

  If include_named_paths is set, named paths from the graph will be stored, if
  it is a PathHandleGraph. If a path_filter is supplied, only paths matching it
  will be stored.

  As above, but build the path cover using local haplotypes. Each window must be consistent
  with the haplotypes in the GBWT index. Instead of choosing the extension with the lowest
  coverage, this algorithm maximizes the D'Hondt ratio:

    true_coverage / (selected_coverage + 1).

  In graph components without haplotypes in the GBWT index, this algorithm will revert to
  the regular path cover algorithm.
