/*
  Build GBWT from GFA P-lines and/or W-lines with the following assumptions:

    1. Links and paths have no overlaps between segments.
    2. There are no containments.

  If the construction fails, the function throws `std::runtime_error`. However,
  if there is an error during the multithreaded path/walk parsing stage,
  the construction exits with `std::exit()`.

  Before GBWT construction, the graph is partitioned into weakly connected
  components. The components are ordered by node ids, and contiguous ranges of
  components are assigned to jobs of roughly equal size. A separate GBWT index
  is built for each job, and the partial indexes are merged using the fast
  algorithm. Multiple jobs can be run in parallel.

  The construction is done in several passes over a memory-mapped GFA file. The
  function returns the GBWT index and a sequence source for GBWTGraph construction.

  If the GFA file contains both P-lines and W-lines, both will be used. In that
  case, P-lines will be interpreted as generic-sense paths and stored under a
  sample named only `REFERENCE_PATH_SAMPLE_NAME`, with the path name as contig
  name. If there are only P-lines, GBWT metadata will be parsed using the
  regular expression defined in the parameters.

  If there are segments longer than the maximum length specified in the parameters,
  such segments will be broken into nodes of that length. If segment identifiers are
  not positive integers, they will be translated into such identifiers. In both
  cases, the sequence source will contain a translation from segment names to
  ranges of node identifiers.

  Writes the graph as GFA into the output stream in a normalized form. The lines are

  1. S-lines ordered by node ids.

  2. L-lines in canonical order. When using a single threads, the edges (from, to)
  are ordered by tuples (id(from), is_reverse(from), id(to), is_reverse(to)).
  All overlaps are `*`.

  3. P-lines for generic paths stored under the sample named only
  `REFERENCE_PATH_SAMPLE_NAME`. When using a single thread, the paths are ordered
  by GBWT path ids. All overlaps are `*`.

  4. W-lines for other paths. When using a single thread, the paths are ordered by
  GBWT path ids.

  If the GBWT does not contain path names, all GBWT paths will be written as P-lines.
